# BlockVote: Enterprise E-Voting System

### Problem Statement
Traditional electronic voting systems face major challenges such as centralized control, security loopholes, and lack of transparency.  
This project, **BlockVote**, aims to solve these issues by building an **Enterprise E-Voting System** on the blockchain using **Ethereum and Ganache**.  
It ensures **voter anonymity**, **prevents double voting**, and maintains **transparency** and **immutability** through the use of **smart contracts** and **decentralized storage**.

## Literature Survey

Traditional electronic voting systems suffer from centralization, security vulnerabilities, and limited transparency, making it difficult to ensure trustworthy and tamper-proof elections. Early blockchain research by Nakamoto [1], Swan [2], and Zyskind et al. [3] demonstrated that decentralized ledgers provide immutability, trustless verification, and secure data handling, forming a strong foundation for blockchain-based e-voting.

Later studies, such as those by McCorry et al. [4], Hardwick et al. [5], and Zhao & Chan [6], showed that Ethereum-based voting protocols and privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques can prevent double voting, improve auditability, and maintain voter anonymity. These works highlight how blockchain significantly enhances election integrity while removing reliance on centralized authorities.

Recent enterprise-oriented research, including González et al. [7], introduced architectures with smart contracts, role-based controls, and immutable audit trails—principles that align directly with BlockVote. This project adopts these proven research concepts by using Solidity, Ganache, and Web3.js to build a transparent, secure, and tamper-proof enterprise e-voting system.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple **Enterprise E-Voting System** built using:
- **Solidity** – Smart contract logic for handling voting securely on the blockchain.  
- **HTML + JavaScript (Web3.js)** – Frontend interface to interact with the smart contract.  
- **Ganache** – A local blockchain used for testing and deploying the smart contract.

## Components Used

1. **Smart Contract (`Voting.sol`)**  
   - Written in Solidity.  
   - Handles election setup, vote casting, and result calculation.  
   - Ensures each voter can vote only once and only the owner can end the election.

2. **Frontend (`index.html`)**  
   - Connects to the blockchain using Web3.js.  
   - Allows users to cast their votes and view results through a simple UI.  
   - Ensures that only the owner can start and end the elections.

3. **Ganache Blockchain**  
   - **Ganache** is a personal Ethereum blockchain used for local development and testing.  
   - It simulates Ethereum behavior without using real Ether or connecting to public testnets.  
   - Ganache automatically provides **10 pre-funded Ethereum accounts**, each loaded with **100 ETH** to deploy contracts and test transactions.

##  How Ganache Is Used in This Project

- The Solidity contract is deployed on the **Ganache local network**.  
- Each Ganache account represents a **voter** or the **election owner**.  
- Transactions like casting votes or deploying contracts are processed locally with zero cost.  
- The frontend connects to Ganache via **MetaMask**, using the RPC URL and chain ID provided by Ganache.
